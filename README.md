# 💡 About Me

Hi, I’m Danish Azhar — a data scientist and product strategist rolled into one, obsessed with the art of turning raw data into real-world results.

### 🔍 My Three: Problem Solver. System Optimizer. Impact Chaser.

I specialize in building intelligent, scalable solutions that detect fraud before it strikes, predict business bottlenecks before they surface, and streamline decision-making before it slows down growth. From working on AI-led logistics at AgReliant Genetics to enabling efficient disaster aid through predictive modeling at Tayaba Welfare International Association, I’ve thrived at the intersection of data, domain expertise, and human-centered design.

### I’m all about:

- Building resilient, AI-powered systems that speak the language of real-world business needs.

- Leveraging the power of Python, SQL, Spark, and Snowflake to fuel performance across industries.

- Finding patterns others miss and solving problems others avoid.

Currently diving deep into NLP, LLMs, and intelligent automation to push the boundaries of what’s possible in operational intelligence.

Looking to collaborate on high-impact, data-first projects that scale with precision and purpose.

Whether it’s automating a broken system or unlocking new value through analytics, I’m the guy who turns chaos into clarity — and models into momentum.

Let’s build the future of smart, efficient, data-driven business — together 🚀
