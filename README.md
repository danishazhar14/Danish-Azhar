# 💡 About Me

Hi, I’m Danish Azhar — a data scientist and product strategist rolled into one, obsessed with the art of turning raw data into real-world results.

### 🔍 Three Words: Problem Solver. System Optimizer. Impact Chaser.

I specialize in building intelligent, scalable solutions that detect fraud before it strikes, predict business bottlenecks before they surface, and streamline decision-making before it slows down growth. From working on AI-led logistics at AgReliant Genetics to enabling efficient disaster aid through predictive modeling at Tayaba Welfare Intl., I’ve thrived at the intersection of data, domain expertise, and human-centered design.

### I’m all about:

- Building resilient, AI-powered systems that speak the language of real-world business needs.

- Leveraging the power of Python, SQL, Spark, and Snowflake to fuel performance across industries.

- Finding patterns others miss and solving problems others avoid.

🧠 Currently diving deep into NLP, LLMs, and intelligent automation to push the boundaries of what’s possible in operational intelligence.
🎯 Looking to collaborate on high-impact, data-first projects that scale with precision and purpose.

Whether it’s automating a broken system or unlocking new value through analytics, I’m the guy who turns chaos into clarity — and models into momentum.

Let’s build the future of smart, efficient, data-driven business — together.
